i decided to uise a basic file structure that is easy to understand and to correct in case  of a bug or a problem in any section of the project
this way if for example ther is a problem on the home page header you can open the folder and correct the mistake in the header folder without interacting with the footer or body of the website
i expect you to be aqiunted with the react js format or the django format which is similar to what i do here but ill try keep it as simp[le as possible
